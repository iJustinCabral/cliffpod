### Project Status - T.B.D. (API Restrictions & Cost)

This is the front end consisting of a NextJS application and Typescript. I created this as an excerise to learn backend programming. While this is the front end, there is also a backend server that fetches all the necessary podcast information, stores it in a datbase, and this frontend fetches it from there. It also uses Google's Gemini API which was fun to mess around with. However, it turns out google has some api restrictions regarding podcasts so I may try switch to OpenAI's whipser in the future if costs ever come down. 

This project was a great learning opportunity to dip my feet into things I've always wanted to learn but put off for one reason or another. I had a great time and will take my knoweldge of building a server into future projects.
